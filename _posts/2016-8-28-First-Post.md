**What did you do this past week?**;
This past week I found myself sitting in a class (an upper-division, one of many, needed for graduation) and it was great.
Within the class we learned about a known feature called import in java, and it was interesteing to see the how its equivalent
was not actually include but actually using namespace. This fact along with many others, helped me begin to understand the
differences between C++ and Java, both with syntax in code as well as what goes in during compilation and runtime.


**What's in your way?**
With the professor, I found the class very organized, but in fact almost too organized and quite unsure if I will be unable to manage
the schoolwork required along with my other classes. Professor Downing's OOP class required strict discipline in answering quiz questions,
doing project that take roughly 3 hours of studying per week and roughly 20 hours of coding per week. However, I am very passionate about
this course and my major as a whole, and as long as I am attentive both in and outside the classroom, I should be fine.


**What will you do next week?**
Next week I will be preparing for next week's set of quizzes as well as begin work on project 1. After 2 days in the OOP course I am beginning
to have a general idea of what to expect in the class.


**tip-of-the-week**
As the quizzes each day are based off of material in the previous class, it is best to study for these quizzes the same day that the material is learned.
