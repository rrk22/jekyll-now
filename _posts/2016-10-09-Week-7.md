**What did you do this past week?**


This past week I was busy studying for two tests, one for Object Oriented Programming, 
and one for my business law class. Furthermore, I was getting ready to go to Dallas this 
weekend to see the annual TX vs. OU match at the state fair with many of my other UT Colleagues.


**What's in your way?**


The main thing that gets in my way is stress. It seems like an endless cycle at times.
I get stressed over the nature of difficult work, I end up doing bad in it, and that leads
me to become even more stressed. I believe it’s one reason why my grades are the way that they are.


**Experience in class**


The main thing I remember from class this week was the actual test. I could’ve been more prepared for it,
but looking at it, I have a general understanding why we did the class exercises that we did, and also why
some of the quiz questions were worded the way that they were in class.

**What will you do next week?**


Next week I will be working on the beginning of Lab 3. I haven’t looked into it much yet, but I will look into it
soon so I can complete the lab to the best of my ability. I’m getting used to typing these labs in C++, I just need
to get better to organize it.



**tip-of-the-week**


Life is too short to worry too much about your mishaps, learn from them and do what you can to not repeat them and move
on with your life. I believe this is what I must do in order to be successful.
